[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/p5.js-widget.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/p5.js-widget)

This is a widget to make it easier to embed editable
p5 sketches in blog posts, interactive curricula, and other places.

For more information on its usage, please see the [website][].

The rest of this documentation is about *developing* p5.js-widget,
not using it.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/toolness/p5.js-widget.git
cd p5.js-widget
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a development server at
http://localhost:8080/.

The development server automatically rebuilds the main JS bundle
whenever you change any of its dependencies.

Note that this project uses [TypeScript][] and [React][]. Many
source files use [ECMAScript 2015][], TypeScript *and* [JSX][],
which can make the code look a bit unfamiliar.

If you're unfamiliar with React, consider reading the
[React Tutorial for p5 Programmers][react-tutorial].

## TypeScript Editor Support

While it's not required for making changes to the codebase, I
*highly* recommend adding [TypeScript Editor Support][] to your editor
of choice. It really makes working on code a lot easier, thanks to
auto-completion and a bunch of other useful features that make it feel
like you've got an experienced coder watching your back.

## CSS

Our CSS is intended to be as standards-compliant as possible, while
leveraging new W3C standards to keep things easy to understand
and maintain. To this end, we use [PostCSS][] with a minimal number
of plugins:

* [autoprefixer][] for vendor prefixing (to support older browsers)
* [postcss-custom-properties][] for [CSS variables][]

## Tests

The test suite can be run on the development server at
http://localhost:8080/test/, or on the command-line with `npm test`.

## Publish to GitHub Pages

Run `npm run publish` to build & publish a site.
